# Travel Packing Application

## Scope

Create an application in which users have a pre-compiled packing list based on a destination's weather, setting, etc. Users can customize their packing list by adding and deleting the pre-compiled list. Users should be able to log in and access their information. 

## MVP

2. As a user, I want to be able to generate a pre-compiled packing list based on choices I select for weather, setting, and packing preferences. 
Juliana testing: POST

3. As a user, I want to be able to customize my pre-compiled list by adding and deleting items. Pawan: testing PUT/DELETE

### Additonal Functionality
4. As a user, I want to be able to share packing lists with others.
